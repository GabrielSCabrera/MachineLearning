    A research project on the efficiency and performance of neural networks is presented. Network systems are compared to both stochastic gradient descent for a logistic case, as well as the Ridge regression scheme for a linear regression case. Taiwanese banking data is used for logistic regression, while Franke's function is used for the linear regression. A central focus of the project is which hyperparameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$ (\textit{l2} regularization and \textit{learning rate}) produce the best predictions for the neural network. It was found that...
