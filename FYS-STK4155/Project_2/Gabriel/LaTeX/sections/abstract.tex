    A research project on the efficiency and performance of neural networks is presented. Network systems are compared to both stochastic gradient descent for a \textit{logistic case}, as well as the Ridge regression scheme for a \textit{linear regression} case. Taiwanese banking data is used for logistic regression, while Franke's function is used for the linear regression. A central focus of the project is the optimization of hyperparameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$ (\textit{l2} regularization and \textit{learning rate}, respectively) in order to produce the best predictions for a feed-forward neural network. It was found that...
