\section{Conclusion}
    % Further improvements:
        % Add a so-called dropout rate
        % Implement cross validation for the search of optimal parameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$
        % Should have maybe implemented MPI4PY (code parallelization), and
        % Should have maybe performed some cross validation to find the optimal parameters. This would however have been very computationally inefficient.
