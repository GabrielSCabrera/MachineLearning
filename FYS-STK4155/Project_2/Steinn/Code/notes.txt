epoch is a pass through the entire dataset.
an iteration is one fb for a batch
do one batch fb until all batches are done. Then reshuffle data.

Class A, Class B: Don't use accuracy as ur only metric
use Confusion matrix and F1 score

Confusion matrix: want diagonality
prediction metrics

See Xavier He for for how to initialize weights and or biases

Testing data must be 80%. You get false accuracies if you upsample testing data.
Scale testing data using the training means and accuracies.


TODO:
Scale testing data using training data mean and std.
Cancel the upsampling of the testing data. This produces false accuracies.
Implement other metrics of accuracies. Confusion matrix, 0_acc, 1_acc etc.
Implement Cumulative Gain Chart.
Implement non-shuffling of batches in neural network.

scikitplot.metrics.plot_cumulative_gain

yp = np.concatenate((1-ypred, ypred), axis=1)

scikit learn sin auc function for area under curve.
Since the values are between zero and one then you have to subtract 0.5 (area of triangle)
