            \caption{Grid search with label $N3$ results. This figure illustrates the accuracy scores for several neural networks with various hyperparameters $\lambda$ and learning rates $\eta$. The range and resolutions of the parameters are in the title, while the indices of the axes range from largest to smallest.}

        Figure \ref{fig:ANNREG2} illustrates the area under the cumulative gain curve for network $N3$:

    \subsection{Regression}
        Following is a table from project 1, listing the precision of three regression schemes applied to Franke's function:
